# Amazon EBS

EBS \(Elastic Block Store\) and [S3](untitled.md) are two file storage services provided by Amazon. The main difference between them is with what they can be used with. EBS is specifically meant for [EC2](../servers/server-fleets.md) \(Elastic Computing Cloud\) instances and is not accessible unless mounted to one.
